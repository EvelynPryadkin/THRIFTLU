# LU Thrift

LU Thrift is a senior capstone project for the Lawrence University thrift room in Colman Hall. Students currently have to visit and search the room to see what's available. The goal is to let them browse online and reserve free items before heading over.

## Planned first version

- Students can browse, search, filter, view item details, and manage their own reservations.
- Staff can add, edit, publish, archive, or mark items missing, and confirm pickups.
- Administrators can manage staff access and operating settings.

Reservations last one hour, with a limit of three active reservations per student. The full hour has to fit within pickup hours. See the [reservation rules](docs/reservation-rules.md) for the details.

The first release covers official thrift-room inventory only. Student Exchange might come later. There are no payments, auctions, ratings, or real-time chat.

## Stack

ASP.NET Core Razor Pages and C# on .NET 10, with Entity Framework Core, PostgreSQL, and xUnit.

## Status

The Week 2 database foundation is in place. The home page reads sample items from a local PostgreSQL database, and a smoke test checks that deleting users or listings can't erase reservation history.

Login, reservation actions, and staff tools are still planned. Pickup hours, room procedures, campus sign-in, hosting, and maintenance are **To Be Confirmed**.

## Running locally

You'll need the .NET 10 SDK and Docker. On a fresh checkout, copy .env.example to .env and choose a local database password. Set the same password in the web project's user secrets, replacing YOUR_LOCAL_PASSWORD below:

```sh
dotnet user-secrets set "ConnectionStrings:DefaultConnection" \
  "Host=127.0.0.1;Port=5433;Database=luthrift;Username=luthrift;Password=YOUR_LOCAL_PASSWORD" \
  --project src/LUThrift.Web
```

Then start the database, apply the migration, and run the app:

```sh
docker compose up -d --wait
dotnet tool restore
dotnet ef database update --project src/LUThrift.Web -- --environment Development
dotnet run --project src/LUThrift.Web --launch-profile https
```

Open https://localhost:7131. The local development certificate may need to be trusted in your browser. Run the test with `dotnet test LUThrift.slnx`.
